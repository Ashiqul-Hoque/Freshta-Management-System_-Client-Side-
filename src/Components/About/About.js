        <p>
          Freshta is an online shop available in most vibrant cities in
          Bangladesh. We believe time is valuable to our fellow city residents,
          and that they should not have to waste hours in traffic, brave harsh
          weather and wait in line just to buy necessities . This is why we
          deliver every day needs to our customersâ€™ door-steps across
          Bangladesh.
          <p>
            Freshta is a work in progress, and we hope to get better over time.
            We are firm believers in using technology and education to improve
            Bangladesh, and we will continue to invest all our effort in pushing
            the boundaries of technology.
            <br></br>

          so we can share that enjoyment of great fresh food for you. It's a
          passion shared by everyone we work with, from the people who grow,
